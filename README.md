Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Sajeena, a future coding legend currently in my secret origin story phase.
My GitHub is a minimalist masterpiece for now, but don't let the quiet fool you. I'm in my training montage fueled by an alarming amount of coffee and a burning desire to build something amazing.
I'm ready to trade my clean commit history for a chance to do some serious hard work. Let's connect and make some magic happen!
